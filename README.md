# mastermind
Classic Mastermind game written in HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS

Mastermind is a game of logic. The purpose of the game
is to decipher a four coloured code. Each hidden colour has a position.
Your job is to find the correct sequence. The hidden code has no
duplicate colours. You have ten attempts to discover the code. On each
attempt the computer will tell you if you have a correct colour in the
correct position with a green indicator. If you have a
correct colour but in the wrong position the computer lets you know with
a white indicator. Blank indicators mean colours you
chose are not part of the hidden code.
